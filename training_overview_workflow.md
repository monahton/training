Welcome to Our Training Program
</h1>
<h3 align="center">
We are delighted to have you here!
</h3>

The training team provides training to help biologists become comfortable with using bioinformatics tools to analyse high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. 

We offer courses and skills at three different levels starting at the basics and building upwards. We focus on the two most commonly used HTS interfaces, **R** and **Bash/Shell**.
