### Where can I find the workshop schedule?

The workshop schedule will be communicated with you upon registration and request.

### When does the registration for a workshop open?

The workshop registration usually opens three weeks prior to the workshop date. We accept participants on a first-come, first-served basis, so register early!

Yes! Please notify us with you interest in one of the provided workshops and we will notify you about the opening

### What if I am not sure whether my lab meets the eligibility requirement?

Please register for the workshop anywway, and we will get back to you.

### What if I am eligible, but the workshop is full when I register?

We will place you on the waiting list, and if no more slots open up this time you will receive priority for the next iteration of the same workshop. You will not have to re-register, we will send you an email with information about the workshop and a mechanism to pay the registration fee.


### I have not attended the basic workshop, can I directly join the advanced workshop if I have the necessary technical background?

We make the decision on a case-by-case basis and we encourage you to do the following:
1. register for the advanced workshop first
2. email us with your experience (please refer to the corresponding workshop registration page for more details about the pre-requisites)

Once we assess your registration+email we will let you know.

### Do I need to attend all sessions of a workshop?

**Yes**, attendance to all sessions is mandatory and expected. If you need to be absent for a small chunk of time, please email us ahead of time. If there are any days that you cannot join due scheduling conflicts, we suggest you wait for the next iteration of the workshop.

### Do you record the workshop on Zoom?

No, we do not record our workshops, and we **do not give permission** for others to record it.

### Do you offer any video tutorials for your training material?

We are currently working on that.
